  <p>If you're looking for the best steamed pork dumplings recipe

     These pork dumplings are as easy to assemble and steam as they are to eat.</p>
     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>
      <li>100 (3.5 inch square) wonton wrappers</li>
      <li>1 3/4 pounds ground pork</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onion</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
      <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
      <li>5 cups finely shredded Chinese cabbage</li>
     </ul>
     <h3>Steps</h3>
     <ol>
      <li>
        Mix the pork, ginger, garlic,
        green onion, soy sauce, sesame oil,
        egg, and cabbage in a large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a teaspoon of filling onto each wonton skin,
        then moisten the edges with water and fold diagonally
        to create a triangle. Roll the edges to seal in the filling.
        Transfer the dumplings to a lightly floured surface until you're ready to cook.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange the pork dumplings in a steamer so that they're
        not touching. Steam until the pork is cooked through.
      </li>
     </ol>
